                <P>
                    Trading stocks is my creative outlet. I really enjoy technical analysis and thus decided to teach
                    myself how to trade stocks as a way to learn the market and build wealth. There are many differrent
                    strategies
                    when it comes analyzing stocks. There are technical and fundamental analysis along with the traders
                    preference for
                    day trading, swing trading, or holding long term. Being that I am a technical analysis swing trader,
                    I rely
                    solely on historical and cyclical data while using certain tools to analyze a stocks entry and exit
                    price. I begin by using a scanner and applying a criteria that includes the tools mention here,
                    MACD, RSI and On-Blance Volume. I select a few stocks to add to my watchlist and create alerts that
                    will tell me when that stock price has reached its high or low. I then creat a table like that one
                    <b>shown above</b> and calculate support, resistance, max loss, and max profit. This gives me a
                    strategy to follow on every trade that helps mitigate risk and along with the indicators I can
                    assure I have a high percentage of making a profit.

            <div class="macd">
                <img src="MACDindicator.png" alt="MACD Example">
            </div>
            <div class="macdSummary">
                <p> MACD stands for Moving Avergage convergence divergence and is one of the more commonly
                    used
                    indicators for technical analysis. This tool follows momentum and indicates whether the stock is
                    headed
                    up
                    or down. This tool uses moving averages and a histogram. As you can see in the picture, when the
                    MACD
                    indicator (in red) crosses the signal line its momentum is headed in that direction. This gives an
                    indication whether it may be a buying opportunity or a selling possibility.

            </div>
            <div class="rsiSummary">
                <p>The RSI, Relative Strenght Index, also tracks momentum and measures the speed and
                    change of
                    a stocks price movements. The indicator ranges from 70 to 30, when the indicator reaches or
                    surpasses 70
                    the stock is considered overbought indicating it may be time to sell since the stock price is most
                    likely to drop. When the indicator reaches or passes 30, the stock is considered
                    oversold indicating the current stock price may be a good entry point since the price is most likely
                    to go up from there. This tool is very popular is technical traders and give a pretty good idea on
                    what the
                    market
                    is thinking in reagards to buying and selling a particular stock.

            </div>
            <div class="balanceSummary">
                <p> On-Balance volume is an indicator of momentum using volume in order to predict price
                    changes. This indicator is a good marker in understanding market sentiment which can predict a
                    bullish
                    or bearish stock. High volume indicates a lot of traffic towards a stock but no way of knowing if
                    market
                    sentiment is bullish or bearish so the tools mentioned here are crucial in using
                    as a
                    relative reference.

                    Once I have created my table and inputted the stocks I am interested in I can use these indicators
                    to time my buy and sell as best I can. I make sure to create limit sells on each trade to a 2% loss
                    (or what I fell comfortable with depedning on stock, market sentiment, ect), and set a sell stop at
                    the resistance price. Key for success is consitancy and sticking to your plan <b>No matter what!</b>
