                After earning my bachelor's degree in business administration from Florida International University, I
                accepted an offer at Ford Credit. While earning my degree I worked in real estate sales, finance, and
                investing and learned a lot about business and real estate. I am currently a Dealer Services Analyst,
                stock
                trader, and my fiance and I Co-own a floral shop specializing in weddings.

                I want to be a software engineer because I enjoy the challenge of creating something from scratch
                that
                can also change people's everyday interactions with software programs and applications. Furthermore, I
                enjoy problem-solving and improving software to optimize its use. Thinking about a career opportunity in
                software development is exciting given that the field is so broad and includes things like machine
                learning and low-code/no-code platforms that will transform how business is conducted.
