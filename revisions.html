            <h2>Revisions Made</h2>

            <p>
                I asked my fiance Diana to revise my website and provide feedback as nicely as possible. She is my
                harshes
                critic but biggest supportor so her insight holds major weight. She is a business owner, territory
                manager, and a brilliant creative mind so her thoughts are important to me and imperative in improving
                my website. <br> The follownig images are screenshot of my website before any updates/revisions
                recommended by my fiance.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="before">
            <div class="beforepic">
                <img src="BeforePic3.PNG" alt="" style="width: 100%;">
            </div>
            <div>
                <img src="BeforePic1.PNG" alt="" style="width: 100%;">
            </div>
            <div>
                <img src="BeforePic2.PNG" alt="" style="width: 100%;">

                After careful review of my website, Diana pointed out some potential improvements and adjustments that I
                could make to my website that would better serve those having to lay eyes upon it... She has a sarcastic
                sense of humor
            </p>
            <h3>Recommendations</h3>
            <div class="reviewList">
                <li>
                    On the creative page there were no headings for each indicator explaination of use and should
                    contain a heading to seperate from each other for better organization.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Suggested to place images directly above image in order to be able to expand image for the reader.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Recommended I add color to the background and a border to the page to frame the website and guide
                    the eyes towards the center of the page.
                </li>
                <li>
                    My font was a too big at 18pt so I minimized it to 15pt.
                </li>
                <li>
                    She also suggested I matched the page border color and the image borders.
                </li>
                <li>
                    My table was not centered
                </li>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>
                After applying the recommended changes to my webpage, this is the final product:
            </p>
            <div class="before">
                <img src="AfterPic1.PNG" alt="" style="width: 100%;">
            </div>
            <div>
                <img src="AfterPic2.PNG" alt="" style="width: 100%;">
            </div>
        </div>

        <h3>Takeaway</h3>

        <div class="takeaway">
            <p>
                Overall this was a fun and educational project. I definitely struggled in certain parts but once I able
                to figure it out, the journey was so rewarding to see how far ive come.
